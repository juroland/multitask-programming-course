# Multi-Task programming course

This course is organized as a practical guide to multi-task programming in the
GNU/Linux environment. It assume a good knowledge of operating system design as
well as the C programming language. Each chapters provides a review of the main
concepts. These reviews should be sufficient for everyone. However, in the
opposite case and if you are not familiar with these subjects, we strongly
recommend that you refer to textbooks on operating systems.
